How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Seeing the difference made it easy to pinpoint where exactly the changes were done. Had ignored it for a long time. Seems useful.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because saving files with different names is a pain in the ass. I know this because I go through it everyday!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros:

You can commit for logical changes

Cons:

You may forget when to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


Because code is likely to be interdependent across files while documents aren't
